## Key Financial Metrics 
**1. Total Number of SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit):** A unique code given to each product by businesses to help track inventory and manage orders. Crunchy Corner holds the distinction of having the largest SKU variety in the industry.

**2. COGS(Cost of Goods Sold):** COGS represents the direct costs a company pays to make the products it sells, such as raw materials, labor, and production costs. It is subtracted from total sales to find out how much profit the company makes from selling its goods.

**3. Gross Profit (GP):** Gross Profit is the money a company makes from selling its products after subtracting the cost of making those products (COGS). It shows how efficiently the company is producing and selling its goods. Gross Profit is calculated by subtracting the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) from Net Revenue.

‚ú®Formula:
**GP=Net Revenue‚àíCOGS**

**4. Net Revenue:** Net Revenue is the money a company keeps after subtracting costs like marketing, distribution, discounts, and other expenses from its total sales. It gives a clearer picture of the company‚Äôs real earnings, which can be used for operations, taxes, and profit.

**Note:** Total revenue is not the same as Net revenue.

Total Revenue refers to the total amount of money a company earns from its sales before any deductions.

Net Revenue is the amount remaining after subtracting different costs. It represents the actual revenue a company retains after these deductions.

**5. EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization):** EBITDA is derived by subtracting operating expenses (like selling, marketing, and administrative costs) from Gross Profit. It reflects the company‚Äôs profitability from its core operations, excluding non-operational and non-cash items.

‚ú®Formula:
**EBITDA=Gross Profit‚àíOperating Expenses**

**6. PAT (Profit After Tax):** PAT is the final profit figure, showing the earnings available to the shareholders. It is derived by subtracting all non-operating expenses (such as taxes, interest, and depreciation) from EBITDA.

‚ú®Formula:
**PAT=EBITDA‚àíInterest‚àíTaxes‚àíDepreciation and Amortization**

**7. Volume:** Volume refers to the total quantity of products sold or the amount of business activity carried out in a given period. In terms of sales, it indicates how many units of a product were sold, helping to assess market demand and business performance.

**8. Raw Material Cost:** Raw Material Costs for Crunchy Corner include the expenses incurred in procuring the basic ingredients required for food preparation. This includes the cost of fresh produce, meats, packaging materials, spices, and other necessary raw materials to ensure high-quality meals are consistently served to customers.

**10.Marketing Cost:** Marketing Cost encompasses the expenses Crunchy Corner invests in advertising, brand promotions, digital campaigns, and other marketing activities aimed at raising brand awareness, reaching new customers, and retaining loyal ones. This could include social media ads, TV commercials, billboards, and promotional events.

**11.Fixed and Variable Costs:**

**Fixed Costs:** These are the expenses that do not change regardless of the restaurant‚Äôs sales volume. For Crunchy Corner, fixed costs include rent for restaurant locations, salaries for management and permanent staff, and utility bills that are constant over time.

**Variable Costs:** These are expenses that fluctuate depending on the volume of sales. For Crunchy Corner, variable costs include raw materials, and transportation costs that vary based on the number of meals sold and orders processed.

General and Administrative (G&A) Costs for Crunchy Corner involve overhead expenses necessary for running the business. These costs include office expenses, salaries for corporate staff, legal fees, insurance, and other administrative functions that support the overall operations of the company but are not directly tied to food production or sales.

**13. Sales and Distribution Costs:**

#### **State-wise Performance:**
Crunchy Corner operates across seven states in India, including Uttar Pradesh (UP), Maharashtra (MH), Gujarat (GUJ), Karnataka, West Bengal (Calcutta), and Tamil Nadu. 

Observations reveal that Uttar Pradesh (UP) contributes the highest Net Revenue of 193.33M, while Tamil Nadu records the lowest Net Revenue contribution of 3.72M among all the states where Crunchy Corner operates.

#### **Distribution Channel Analysis**
Crunchy Corner utilizes nine distinct distribution channels to sell its products: Direct Sales, Bulk Sales, Culinary Service, Distributor, External Sales, Domestic Sales, Online Sales, Others, and MFG Sales. Let‚Äôs identify which distribution channel contributes the highest Net Revenue.

As observed, Direct Sales contribute the most to the Net Revenue, followed closely by Bulk Sales.

#### **Cluster Head Analysis**
Crunchy Corner, being a large fast-food distribution chain, assigns Cluster Heads to manage and oversee operations across different regions, ensuring efficient business functioning and optimized performance. Let‚Äôs now analyze the Net Revenue by Cluster Heads to gain valuable insights into Crunchy Corner‚Äôs overall performance under each cluster head.

It appears that under Cluster Head Umar, the highest Net Revenue is being generated, indicating strong performance and efficient management strategies being implemented by Umar.

#### **Category-wise Analysis**
As Crunchy Corner is a renowned fast-food restaurant chain with the largest SKU base in the industry, it offers products across nine different categories. Let‚Äôs now analyze the Net Revenue by SKU category to understand which categories contribute the most to the company‚Äôs overall revenue.

As observed, the Protein Pack category generates the highest Net Revenue, followed by Fresh Fare and Country Fries, contributing significantly to Crunchy Corner‚Äôs overall revenue.

#### **Cost Analysis**
Now that we‚Äôve completed the analysis of Crunchy Corner‚Äôs overall performance, let‚Äôs dive deeper into the cost analysis. By examining various costs such as raw material costs, marketing expenses, sales and distribution costs, and fixed and variable costs, we can gain a clearer understanding of the factors impacting profitability. This will allow us to identify areas for cost optimization, improve operational efficiency, and develop strategies to enhance overall financial performance in the long term.

Below is the Cost Analysis Funnel Chart, which visualizes the various costs incurred by Crunchy Corner. The chart breaks down key cost categories, providing a clear view of how expenses.

#### **Marketing Cost Analysis**
As we can observe, the top-performing category, Protein Pack, is also responsible for generating the highest marketing cost, which is in line with the increased efforts to promote and drive sales in this high-revenue category.

#### **Actual VS Budget Insights** 
In this problem statement, we are provided with both actual data and the target/budget of the company. This dual dataset allows us to compare and evaluate the company‚Äôs performance against the set goals, identifying any variances. Let‚Äôs deep dive into it ‚Äî

Firstly, let‚Äôs analyze YOY Net Revenue for both actual and budget data
```
NR ‚Äî Net Revenue (Actual)

B NR ‚Äî Net Revenue (Budget)

YOY NR B% ‚Äî YOY NR % (Budget)
```
- In 2021 and 2022, the actual NR is closer to the budget, reflecting better alignment with financial projections.
- In 2023, actual NR not only fails to meet the budget but also reflects a dip in performance, as shown by the steep YoY decline.
- 2024 continues to show a gap, but the negative YoY change indicates a gradual performance improvement.

Now, let‚Äôs analyze and compare the Year-over-Year (YoY) Net Revenue for actual and budgeted data across categories.
- Protein Pack is the highest revenue-generating category with Actual NR at 221M and Budgeted NR at 259M. However, there is a significant -14.42% YoY decline in Budgeted NR, indicating potential challenges in sustaining growth.
- Fresh Fare and Country Fries categories exhibit modest revenue levels (82M and 76M, respectively), and their YoY Budget NR% % indicates steady growth (+8.57% and +11.81%, respectively).
- Cake and Sweet Crust categories exhibit the lowest net revenue levels with declining YoY Budget percentages of -14.28% and -9.87%, respectively.
